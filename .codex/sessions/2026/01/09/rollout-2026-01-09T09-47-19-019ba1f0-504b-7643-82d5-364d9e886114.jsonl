Expérience Utilisateur (UX) ciblée\n\nL’application sert des experts métiers PDD (Pilotes De la Demande) et privilégie la rapidité,\nla lisibilité et l’efficacité pour un usage intensif. L’interface est responsive et accessible,\nmais aucun compromis n’est accepté sur la vitesse d’exécution ou la clarté des actions clés.\n\n### II. Langue et communication\n\n- Français obligatoire pour toute documentation, spécification, ticket et prompt IA.\n- L’IA doit répondre exclusivement en français.\n- Exceptions limitées : code, identifiants (API, classes, variables) et citations externes.\n- Interdiction de livrer une spécification ou un prompt entièrement en anglais (hors exceptions).\n\n### III. Conventions de développement et de spécification\n\nLe document `specs/spec-convention.md` est la source unique de vérité pour la rédaction des\nspecs Speckit (écrans, APIs, entités). En cas de conflit avec un autre document, ses règles\npriment. Toute spec doit être traçable, testable et rédigée en français avec user stories\nindépendantes et scénarios Given/When/Then.\n\n### IV. Invariants techniques\n\n- Stack imposée : backend Node.js (LTS) en REST HTTP/JSON avec validation des payloads côté\n  backend ; frontend React + TypeScript + Vite utilisant exclusivement les Web Components WCS\n  (`.specify/support/wcs` comme référence) ; PostgreSQL via Sequelize/CLI pour la base.\n- Les specs Speckit ne doivent proposer que des architectures compatibles avec cette stack.\n- Les APIs et entités doivent rester cohérentes avec des routes REST Node.js et une base SQL.\n\n## Invariants techniques et assets de référence\n\n- Conventions techniques détaillées dans `specs/technical-conventions.md` : toute dérogation\n  doit être validée par un architecte et documentée.\n\n## Organisation des spécifications Speckit\n\n- Dossiers de spec par story : `specs/<nom-story>/` regroupant écrans (screen-*), APIs\n  (api-*) et entités (entity-*).\n- Templates obligatoires : `specs/screen-template.md`, `specs/api-template.md`,\n  `specs/entity-template.md` comme base de chaque fichier.\n\n## Gouvernance\n\n- La présente Constitution est la référence du projet AFA et prime sur tout autre document.\n- Amendements : documentés, approuvés par un architecte, communiqués à l’équipe produit et\n  intégrés dans cette Constitution avec incrément de version sémantique.\n- Contrôles systématiques : toute revue (spec, plan, tâches, code) vérifie la conformité aux\n  principes I-IV, à `specs/spec-convention.md` et à `specs/technical-conventions.md`.\n- Versioning : MAJOR pour changements incompatibles ou suppression de principes, MINOR pour\n  ajout/extension de principe ou section, PATCH pour clarifications sans impact de fond.\n- Tout écart doit être justifié dans le plan ou la spec concernée avec alternative plus simple\n  évaluée ; aucune livraison n’est acceptée si la langue ou la stack s’écartent des principes.\n\n**Version**: 0.0.1 | **Ratified**: 2025-11-23 | **Last Amended**: 2025-11-23\n"}}

Draft the updated constitution content:\n   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet—explicitly justify any left).\n   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.\n   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non‑negotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.\n   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.\n\n4. Consistency propagation checklist (convert prior checklist into active validations):\n   - Read `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` and ensure any \"Constitution Check\" or rules align with updated principles.\n   - Read `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` for scope/requirements alignment—update if constitution adds/removes mandatory sections or constraints.\n   - Read `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` and ensure task categorization reflects new or removed principle-driven task types (e.g., observability, versioning, testing discipline).\n   - Read each command file in `.specify/templates/commands/*.md` (including this one) to verify no outdated references (agent-specific names like CLAUDE only) remain when generic guidance is required.\n   - Read any runtime guidance docs (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, or agent-specific guidance files if present). Update references to principles changed.\n\n5.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Implemented independently\n  - Tested independently\n  - Delivered as an MVP increment\n  \n  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.\n  ============================================================================\n-->\n\n## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)\n\n**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure\n\n- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan\n- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies\n- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)\n\n**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented\n\n**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete\n\nExamples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):\n\n- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations framework\n- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework\n- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure\n- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities that all stories depend on\n- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure\n- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management\n\n**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP\n\n**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]\n\n**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]\n\n### Tests for User Story 1 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️\n\n> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**\n\n- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py\n- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py\n\n### Implementation for User Story 1\n\n- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py\n- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py\n- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py (depends on T012, T013)\n- [ ] T015 [US1] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py\n- [ ] T016 [US1] Add validation and error handling\n- [ ] T017 [US1] Add logging for user story 1 operations\n\n**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)\n\n**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]\n\n**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]\n\n### Tests for User Story 2 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️\n\n- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py\n- [ ] T019 [P] [US2] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py\n\n### Implementation for User Story 2\n\n- [ ] T020 [P] [US2] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py\n- [ ] T021 [US2] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py\n- [ ] T022 [US2] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py\n- [ ] T023 [US2] Integrate with User Story 1 components (if needed)\n\n**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently\n\n---\n\n## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)\n\n**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]\n\n**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]\n\n### Tests for User Story 3 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️\n\n- [ ] T024 [P] [US3] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py\n- [ ] T025 [P] [US3] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py\n\n### Implementation for User Story 3\n\n- [ ] T026 [P] [US3] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py\n- [ ] T027 [US3] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py\n- [ ] T028 [US3] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py\n\n**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional\n\n---\n\n[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]\n\n---\n\n## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\n\n**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories\n\n- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/\n- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring\n- [ ] TXXX Performance optimization across all stories\n- [ ] TXXX [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in tests/unit/\n- [ ] TXXX Security hardening\n- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation\n\n---\n\n## Dependencies & Execution Order\n\n### Phase Dependencies\n\n- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately\n- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories\n- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion\n  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)\n  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)\n- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete\n\n### User Story Dependencies\n\n- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable\n\n### Within Each User Story\n\n- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation\n- Models before services\n- Services before endpoints\n- Core implementation before integration\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\n\n### Parallel Opportunities\n\n- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\n- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)\n- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)\n- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members\n\n---\n\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\n\n```bash\n"}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Vision du service\r\n\r\nr3edge-app est l’outil métier utilisé au quotidien par les traders abonnés au service r3edge.  \r\nCe n’est pas une application grand public : c’est une application métier permettant de piloter des sessions de trading automatisé.\r\n\r\nContrairement à un système de trading classique centré sur les ordres unitaires, r3edge-app se concentre sur la **gestion de sessions de trading globales**.  \r\nLe trader r3edge ne place pas manuellement des ordres : il **s’abonne aux signaux d’une stratégie**, configure les paramètres adaptés à son profil, puis **pilote des sessions** qu’il supervise en temps réel.\r\n\r\nr3edge n’est pas non plus une plateforme de copy trading : on ne reproduit pas les décisions d’un autre trader humain.  \r\nOn travaille avec des **stratégies explicites**, testées et documentées.  \r\nChaque stratégie peut disposer d’une **fiche de performance** (backtests, paper tests, indicateurs de comportement), afin que le trader puisse évaluer sa pertinence avant de l’utiliser en conditions réelles.\r\n\r\nL’application doit soutenir un état d’esprit de **clarté** et de **sérénité** : des montants importants peuvent être engagés, la session temps réel doit être agréable à regarder, lisible, sans effets de clignotement ni bruit visuel inutile.  \r\nr3edge-app vise ainsi à offrir une vue unifiée, maîtrisée et apaisée de l’activité du trader, tout en masquant la complexité du moteur algorithmique sous-jacent.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. Rôle stratégique du frontend\r\n\r\nLe frontend sert de **boussole** au trader : il lui permet immédiatement de savoir où il en est — son PnL global, ses sessions actives, et la dynamique des stratégies qu’il exploite.  \r\nIl offre aussi un accès direct à l’historique, afin de rejouer les sessions passées et d’analyser le comportement réel des stratégies sélectionnées.  \r\nCes analyses permettent au trader de mieux comprendre les modèles qu’il utilise, mais aussi de formuler des retours aux quants en charge de la création et de l’évolution des stratégies.\r\n\r\nL’application se veut volontairement **simple d’usage** et **faiblement chargée en données**.  \r\nLes écrans privilégient des **indicateurs agrégés** (cartes, chiffres clés, graphiques de synthèse) plutôt que des listes exhaustives.  \r\nChaque chiffre ou graphique agrégé peut être **déplié sur demande** (clic ou interaction explicite) pour accéder au détail uniquement lorsque le trader le souhaite.  \r\nL’objectif est de limiter la **charge cognitive** pendant le travail réel : le trader voit l’essentiel en un coup d’œil, puis explore en profondeur lorsqu’il en a besoin.\r\n\r\nLe frontend est donc à la fois :\r\n- un **instrument de pilotage** des sessions en cours,\r\n- une **fenêtre de compréhension** de la valeur des stratégies,\r\n- et un **support de collaboration** entre traders et quants (via les sessions rejouées et les performances observées).\r\n\r\nIl doit encourager un état mental de **contrôle, lisibilité et confiance**, plutôt qu’une sur-stimulation visuelle.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3. Portée fonctionnelle du MVP\r\n\r\nInclus :\r\n\r\n- **Dashboard** — donne en un coup d’œil l’état global de l’activité (sessions, PnL, comptes, activité récente).\r\n- **Infos Marché** — permet de ressentir les conditions de marché avant de lancer ou d’ajuster des sessions.\r\n- **PnL** — offre une vue synthétique de la performance globale et des risques, pour situer son exposition.\r\n- **Sessions de Trading (actives + création + clôturées)** — espace central de création, pilotage et revue des sessions.\r\n- **Stratégies** — présente les stratégies disponibles et leur rôle dans les sessions, comme base de confiance.\r\n- **Social (placeholder)** — prépare un futur espace de comparaison, partage ou inspiration entre utilisateurs.\r\n- **Info Application** — informe sur l’état du service, les limitations éventuelles et l’évolution du produit.\r\n- **Profil utilisateur + Préférences de Trading** — permet de configurer ses comptes de trading et son cadre d’usage.\r\n- **Flux SSE simulé pour les sessions en cours** — support technique pour afficher une supervision temps réel crédible.\r\n- **API mock intégrale via MSW** — permet de tester l’UX complète sans dépendre d’un backend en production.\r\n- **authentication avec Auth0** (les éléments techniques clientid et secrets sont disponibles)\r\n\r\nExclus :\r\n- Analyse avancée des sessions\r\n- Graphiques complexes\r\n\r\n# 4.

Backend (MVP)# 5. Backend (MVP)\r\n\r\nLe backend du MVP r3edge-app joue un rôle **volontairement limité**.  \r\nIl ne porte ni l’exécution des stratégies ni le trading temps réel, qui relèvent d’un **backend métier distinct**, branché ultérieurement.\r\n\r\nDans le cadre du MVP frontend, ce backend sert de **socle applicatif** :\r\n- gestion du profil utilisateur,\r\n- préférences et paramètres UX,\r\n- configuration des comptes de trading,\r\n- exposition d’API simples permettant au frontend de fonctionner dans des conditions proches du réel.\r\n\r\nIl fournit ainsi un point d’ancrage stable, sans introduire la complexité du moteur algorithmique.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5.1 Stack et principes\r\n\r\nLe backend repose sur une stack volontairement lisible et éprouvée :\r\n\r\n- Express + Feathers v5 pour l’exposition d’API REST par services,\r\n- Sequelize + PostgreSQL pour la persistance,\r\n- Auth0 (JWT Bearer) pour l’authentification,\r\n- Pino pour la journalisation,\r\n- Swagger pour la documentation (`/api/docs`).\r\n\r\nL’objectif est la **clarté** et la **compatibilité avec un frontend mocké via MSW**, plus que la sophistication technique.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5.2 Services exposés\r\n\r\n### Profil utilisateur  \r\n`/api/v1/users/me` (GET / PUT)\r\n\r\nCe service :\r\n- crée ou met à jour le profil applicatif à partir des claims Auth0,\r\n- assigne un rôle par défaut (`trader`),\r\n- stocke les préférences UX et la locale,\r\n- expose des indicateurs simples utilisés par le frontend (ex. présence de clés API).\r\n\r\nIl agit comme un **miroir applicatif** de l’identité Auth0.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Comptes de trading  \r\n`/api/v1/trading-accounts`  \r\n(GET / POST / PATCH / DELETE / POST `:id/test`)\r\n\r\nCe service permet de :\r\n- gérer les comptes de trading par plateforme,\r\n- administrer les clés API associées,\r\n- vérifier symboliquement la configuration d’un compte.\r\n\r\nLes clés ne sont jamais exposées en clair (`apiKeyMasked`) et l’accès est strictement filtré par utilisateur.  \r\nL’action de “test” est un **placeholder MVP** : elle met à jour un indicateur sans valider réellement la clé.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Service de démonstration  \r\n`/api/v1/items`\r\n\r\nCRUD simple utilisé comme :\r\n- référence technique,\r\n- support de test et de debug,\r\n- exemple de service Feathers standard.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5.3 Sécurité et intégration frontend\r\n\r\nLes services sensibles sont protégés par un **Bearer JWT obligatoire** via un middleware commun.  \r\nAucune autorisation fine complexe n’est introduite à ce stade.\r\n\r\nLe frontend peut :\r\n- fonctionner entièrement en mode mocké (MSW),\r\n- ou appeler le backend réel en désactivant certains mocks via variables d’environnement.\r\n\r\nCette dualité permet d’itérer rapidement sur l’UX sans dépendre de l’avancement backend.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5.4 Évolutivité\r\n\r\nLe backend MVP couvre uniquement :\r\n- l’identité applicative,\r\n- les préférences utilisateur,\r\n- la configuration des comptes de trading.\r\n\r\nIl est conçu comme une **fondation extensible** :\r\n- les sessions et le trading temps réel seront branchés sur le backend métier,\r\n- les données marché, PnL, social et stratégies seront enrichies progressivement,\r\n- sans remise en cause de la structure actuelle.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# 6.

Dans tous les cas, **une seule branche par feature** est utilisée jusqu’à la PR.\n\nAprès le merge, la branche de feature est conservée pour archive.

Le build/artefact doit partir du tag.\n- Les versions affichées en runtime proviennent automatiquement des `package.json` : côté front (constante injectée par Vite), côté back (/api/info et page racine). Pas de saisie manuelle dans le code ou le .env.\n\n### Environnements (backend)\n- `NODE_ENV` est binaire pour Node/Express : `production` active les optimisations (logs JSON, mode prod). Toute autre valeur est considérée comme dev.\n- `APP_ENV` sert à nommer l’environnement fonctionnel (dev/staging/preprod/prod) et est affiché dans `/` et `/api/info`. Laisser `NODE_ENV=production` en staging/preprod/prod pour garder le comportement prod, mais ajuster `APP_ENV` selon le contexte.\n\n## Git tips\n\n- **Upstream (tracking branch)** : lie une branche locale à sa branche distante pour éviter de préciser le remote/branche à chaque commande.  \n  - Exemple : à la création/premier push d’une feature :  \n    ```bash\n    git push -u origin feature/ma-feature\n    ```  \n    ou si la branche existe déjà côté remote :  \n    ```bash\n    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/feature/ma-feature feature/ma-feature\n    ```\n  - Intérêt : ensuite `git push` / `git pull` sans arguments utilisent automatiquement `origin/feature/ma-feature`, ce qui réduit les erreurs et la frappe répétitive.\n"}}

Elle pourra être supprimée\\nultérieurement lors d’opérations de nettoyage sporadiques.\\n\\n## 1) Cloner et préparer le dépôt\\n\\n```bash\\ngit clone <URL_DU_REPO>\\ncd <DOSSIER_DU_REPO>\\ngit remote -v             # vérifier l’URL\\ngit branch --show-current # vérifier la branche active (souvent main)\\ngit status                # état initial propre ?\\n```\\n\\nCréation de la branche feature :\\n- **Manuel** : depuis `main` à jour (`git pull`), créer et basculer sur la branche :\\n  ```bash\\n  git switch -c feature/<NOM_FEATURE>\\n  ```\\n\\nLes itérations se font **uniquement** sur cette branche (pas de branches intermédiaires).\\n\\n## 2) Développer sur la branche de feature\\n\\nTravaille, teste, vérifie fréquemment :\\n```bash\\ngit status   # fichiers modifiés ?\\ngit diff     # relire avant commit\\n```\\n\\n## 3) Commit et push\\n\\nQuand la feature est prête (ou pour un incrément cohérent) :\\n```bash\\ngit add .                        # ou fichier par fichier\\ngit status                       # vérifier la staging area\\ngit commit -m \\\"Message clair\\\"    # ex : \\\"Add README for <NOM_PROJET>\\\"\\ngit push -u origin feature/<NOM_FEATURE>\\n```\\n\\n## 4) Ouvrir la Pull Request\\n\\n- Depuis l’UI GitHub/GitLab : comparer `feature/<NOM_FEATURE>` → `main`,\\n  décrire le changement et les tests faits.\\n- Avec GitHub CLI (optionnel) :\\n  ```bash\\n  gh pr create --fill\\n  ```\\n\\n## 5) Rôle de l’intégrateur\\n\\n- Relit la PR, demande d’éventuelles modifications en échangeant directement avec le\\n  développeur.\\n- Merge dans `main` quand c’est validé.\\n- Tag la branche main par exemple :\\n\\n```bash\\ngit tag -a v0.2.0 -m \\\"v0.2.0\\\"\\ngit push origin v0.2.0\\n```\\n\\n- Décide de la gestion/suppression des branches distantes (le développeur ne les supprime pas).\\n\\n### Routine de version applicative (backend/front)\\n- Juste avant la release : bumper la version dans les `package.json` concernés\\n  (backend, frontend si applicable) avec `npm version`.\\n- Exemple release patch backend uniquement :\\n  ```bash\\n  cd backend\\n  npm version patch   # met à jour package.json et package-lock.json, crée un commit et un tag vX.Y.Z\\n  git push origin HEAD --tags\\n  ```\\n- Exemple release patch frontend uniquement :\\n  ```bash\\n  cd frontend\\n  npm version patch   # met à jour package.json et package-lock.json, crée un commit et un tag vX.Y.Z\\n  git push origin HEAD --tags\\n  ```\\n- Exemple release coordonnée front + back (monorepo) :\\n  ```bash\\n  cd backend && npm version minor && cd ..\\n  cd frontend && npm version minor && cd ..\\n  git add backend/package*.json frontend/package*.json\\n  git commit -m \\\"chore: bump versions\\\"\\n  git tag -a v0.3.0 -m \\\"v0.3.0\\\"\\n  git push origin HEAD --tags\\n  ```\\n- Toujours tagger sur le commit qui contient le bump de version. Le build/artefact doit\\n  partir du tag.\\n- Les versions affichees en runtime proviennent automatiquement des `package.json` :\\n  cote front (constante injectee par Vite), cote back (/api/info et page racine).\\n  Pas de saisie manuelle dans le code ou le .env.\\n\\n### Environnements (backend)\\n- `NODE_ENV` est binaire pour Node/Express : `production` active les optimisations\\n  (logs JSON, mode prod). Toute autre valeur est consideree comme dev.\\n- `APP_ENV` sert a nommer l’environnement fonctionnel (dev/staging/preprod/prod) et est\\n  affiche dans `/` et `/api/info`. Laisser `NODE_ENV=production` en staging/preprod/prod\\n  pour garder le comportement prod, mais ajuster `APP_ENV` selon le contexte.\\n\\n## Git tips\\n\\n- **Upstream (tracking branch)** : lie une branche locale a sa branche distante pour eviter\\n  de preciser le remote/branche a chaque commande.\\n  - Exemple : a la creation/premier push d’une feature :\\n    ```bash\\n    git push -u origin feature/<NOM_FEATURE>\\n    ```\\n    ou si la branche existe deja cote remote :\\n    ```bash\\n    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/feature/<NOM_FEATURE> feature/<NOM_FEATURE>\\n    ```\\n  - Interet : ensuite `git push` / `git pull` sans arguments utilisent automatiquement\\n    `origin/feature/<NOM_FEATURE>`, ce qui reduit les erreurs et la frappe repetitive.\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier\"}","call_id":"call_zfgOnmBq1Wn0BYhbX1y9JPEM"}}

Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Codex. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Codex instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\n\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\n\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above:\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md:315 -> , delete any placeholder files that are not needed for the skill. Only create resource directories that are actually required.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n##### Frontmatter\n\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md:326 -> : This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Codex understand when to use the skill.\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Codex.\n  - Example description for a\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/prompts/speckit.constitution.md:19 -> ). Your job is to (a) collect/derive concrete values, (b) fill the template precisely, and (c) propagate any amendments across dependent artifacts.\n\nFollow this execution flow:\n\n1. Load the existing constitution template at\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/prompts/speckit.constitution.md:24 -> .\n   **IMPORTANT**: The user might require less or more principles than the ones used in the template. If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.\n\n2. Collect/derive values for placeholders:\n   - If user input (conversation) supplies a value, use it.\n   - Otherwise infer from existing repo context (README, docs, prior constitution versions if embedded).\n   - For governance dates:\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/prompts/speckit.constitution.md:31 -> must increment according to semantic versioning rules:\n     - MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.\n     - MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.\n     - PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.\n   - If version bump type ambiguous, propose reasoning before finalizing.\n\n3. Draft the updated constitution content:\n   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet—explicitly justify any left).\n   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.\n   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non‑negotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.\n   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.\n\n4. Consistency propagation checklist (convert prior checklist into active validations):\n   - Read\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/prompts/speckit.constitution.md:45 -> for scope/requirements alignment—update if constitution adds/removes mandatory sections or constraints.\n   - Read\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/prompts/speckit.constitution.md:48 -> , or agent-specific guidance files if present). Update references to principles changed.\n\n5. Produce a Sync Impact Report (prepend as an HTML comment at top of the constitution file after update):\n   - Version change: old → new\n   - List of modified principles (old title → new title if renamed)\n   - Added sections\n   - Removed sections\n   - Templates requiring updates (✅ updated / ⚠ pending) with file paths\n   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders intentionally deferred.\n\n6. Validation before final output:\n   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens.\n   - Version line matches report.\n   - Dates ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.\n   - Principles are declarative, testable, and free of vague language (\"should\" → replace with MUST/SHOULD rationale where appropriate).\n\n7. Write the completed constitution back to\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/prompts/speckit.constitution.md:69 -> ).\n\nFormatting & Style Requirements:\n\n- Use Markdown headings exactly as in the template (do not demote/promote levels).\n- Wrap long rationale lines to keep readability (<100 chars ideally) but do not hard enforce with awkward breaks.\n- Keep a single blank line between sections.\n- Avoid trailing whitespace.\n\nIf the user supplies partial updates (e.g., only one principle revision), still perform validation and version decision steps.\n\nIf critical info missing (e.g., ratification date truly unknown), insert\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/prompts/speckit.clarify.md:25 -> mode /\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/prompts/speckit.clarify.md:29 -> or verify feature branch environment.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).\n\n   Functional Scope & Behavior:\n   - Core user goals & success criteria\n   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations\n   - User roles / personas differentiation\n\n   Domain & Data Model:\n   - Entities, attributes, relationships\n   - Identity & uniqueness rules\n   - Lifecycle/state transitions\n   - Data volume / scale assumptions\n\n   Interaction & UX Flow:\n   - Critical user journeys / sequences\n   - Error/empty/loading states\n   - Accessibility or localization notes\n\n   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:\n   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)\n   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)\n   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)\n   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)\n   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)\n   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)\n\n   Integration & External Dependencies:\n   - External services/APIs and failure modes\n   - Data import/export formats\n   - Protocol/versioning assumptions\n\n   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:\n   - Negative scenarios\n   - Rate limiting / throttling\n   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)\n\n   Constraints & Tradeoffs:\n   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)\n   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives\n\n   Terminology & Consistency:\n   - Canonical glossary terms\n   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms\n\n   Completion Signals:\n   - Acceptance criteria testability\n   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators\n\n   Misc / Placeholders:\n   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions\n   - Ambiguous adjectives (\"robust\", \"intuitive\") lacking quantification\n\n   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:\n   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy\n   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)\n\n3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as:\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/prompts/speckit.clarify.md:122 -> - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/prompts/speckit.clarify.md:138 -> section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/prompts/speckit.clarify.md:140 -> .\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/prompts/speckit.clarify.md:161 -> .\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/prompts/speckit.plan.md:23 -> from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/prompts/speckit.plan.md:25 -> . Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).\n\n3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:\n   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as \"NEEDS CLARIFICATION\")\n   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution\n   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)\n   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)\n   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md\n   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script\n   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design\n\n4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.\n\n## Phases\n\n### Phase 0: Outline & Research\n\n1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:\n   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task\n   - For each dependency → best practices task\n   - For each integration → patterns task\n\n2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/prompts/speckit.plan.md:67 -> :\n   - Entity name, fields, relationships\n   - Validation rules from requirements\n   - State transitions if applicable\n\n2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:\n   - For each user action → endpoint\n   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns\n   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/prompts/speckit.tasks.md:24 -> from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list.

Load\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/prompts/speckit.specify.md:71 -> to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/prompts/speckit.specify.md:140 -> b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/prompts/speckit.specify.md:183 -> - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (\n- /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/prompts/speckit.taskstoissues.md:16 -> from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list.

stabiliser le **modèle métier côté frontend**\n- de tester l’intégralité du CRUD sans backend\n- d’aligner naturellement MSW et Feathers\n- de générer ensuite facilement les modèles Sequelize et services Feathers\n\nÉtapes suivantes :\n- introduire une **validation métier** structurée avec Zod\n- extraire le modèle vers une **lib shared** front/back\n- automatiser la génération backend (ORM, services) à partir du modèle stabilisé\n- basculer vers un pattern DTO\n\nLe cœur de la valeur reste le **modèle métier**, pas la technologie.\n\n\n## Annexes\n\n### Évolution vers un pattern DTO\n\nLe pattern **DTO-less API** est idéal pour :\n- démarrer vite\n- réduire le code inutile\n- stabiliser le modèle métier\n- faciliter la génération backend (humaine ou IA)\n\nLorsque la complexité augmente (sécurité, champs internes, divergences de shape),  \nil devient pertinent d’introduire un **pattern DTO**.\n\n### Ajouts nécessaires (sans remise en cause)\n\n#### Frontend\n-

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Objectif\n\nFournir des spécifications lisibles par un humain (français), alignées avec la Constitution AFA et\nexploitables directement par `plan.md`, `tasks.md` et les équipes front/back/data.\n\nLes spécifications doivent permettre à l’IA et aux humains de comprendre clairement :\n- le besoin métier,\n- l’impact sur les écrans, les APIs et les données,\n- les critères de succès et les tests associés.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Organisation des fichiers\n\nLa racine des spécifications Speckit est :\n\nspecs/\n    spec-convention.md        # conventions de rédaction (ce fichier)\n    screen-template.md        # template global pour les écrans\n    api-template.md           # template global pour les APIs\n    entity-template.md        # template global pour les entités\n\n    001-<nom-increment>/\n      screen-*.md             # écrans de cet incrément (optionnel)\n      api-*.md                # APIs de cet incrément (optionnel)\n      entity-*.md             # entités de cet incrément (optionnel)\n\n    002-<nom-increment>/\n      ...\n\n- Chaque répertoire NNN-<nom-increment> représente un incrément fonctionnel.\n- Tous les fichiers de specs liés à cet incrément (écrans, APIs, entités) sont regroupés dans ce répertoire.\n- Les templates globaux servent de base pour chaque nouveau fichier.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Types de fichiers et templates obligatoires\n\nDans chaque répertoire d’incrément (001-.../, 002-.../, etc.) :\n\n- screen-*.md  \n  → doit suivre la structure décrite dans screen-template.md.\n\n- api-*.md  \n  → doit suivre la structure décrite dans api-template.md.\n\n- entity-*.md  \n  → doit suivre la structure décrite dans entity-template.md.\n\nRappels :\n- Nommage en kebab-case : screen-sessions.md, api-sessions-list.md, entity-session.md.\n- Un fichier par sujet : une entité, une API, un écran.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Langue et ton\n\n- Langue : français.\n- Phrases courtes, vocabulaire métier explicite.\n- Éviter le jargon technique non expliqué (ou le définir rapidement).\n- Prioriser la compréhension par un humain avant tout formatage machine.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Structure minimale d’une spec (quel que soit le type)\n\nChaque fichier de spec (écran, API, entité) doit inclure au minimum :\n\n### 5.1 Métadonnées\n\nBloc en haut de fichier :\n\n- Nom de l’incrément (ex : 001-session-list).\n- Branche Git associée (ex : 001-session-list).\n- Statut : Draft / Reviewed / Approved.\n- Date de dernière mise à jour.\n- Auteur / relecteur (optionnel).\n\n### 5.2 Contenu structuré\n\nSuivant le type (screen/api/entity), utiliser le template correspondant :\n- Objectif métier clair.\n- Règles visibles / comportement attendu.\n- Références aux autres specs (screen/api/entity) si nécessaire.\n- Historique / incréments de cette spec.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Règles d’écriture des user stories\n\nLorsque des user stories sont présentes dans une spec :\n\n- Chaque story doit être un incrément autonome, implémentable et déployable seule.\n- Scénarios d’acceptation structurés en Given / When / Then, couvrant :\n  - au moins un cas de succès,\n  - les erreurs métiers prévisibles.\n- Tests à prévoir :\n  - validations front (comportement visible),\n  - validations back (contrats d’API),\n  - validations données (persistance, intégrité).\n\n---\n\n## 7. Règles d’exigences et de couverture\n\n- Les exigences fonctionnelles (FR-xxx) couvrent uniquement le périmètre de la spec.\n- Les extensions futures sont reportées en backlog.\n- Toute interface nouvelle ou modifiée doit préciser :\n  - les I/O attendus,\n  - les principaux scénarios d’intégration.\n- Edge cases à considérer :\n  - absence de données,\n  - limites de pagination,\n  - droits insuffisants,\n  - valeurs incohérentes,\n  - timeouts / erreurs visibles.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Alignement front / back / base de données\n\nPour chaque incrément :\n\n- Identifier, quand c’est pertinent :\n  - les écrans concernés (screen-*.md),\n  - les APIs concernées (api-*.md),\n  - les entités manipulées (entity-*.md).\n- Décrire les règles backend :\n  - propriétés garanties,\n  - tri / pagination,\n  - filtrage,\n  - statuts / droits.\n- Préciser la source de vérité :\n  - base de données,\n  - cache,\n  - stockage front.\n\n---\n\n## 9. UX interne (productivité)\n\n- Optimiser pour des experts internes : peu de friction, informations clés visibles, raccourcis clavier possibles.\n- Messages et erreurs : compréhensibles, en français, cohérents entre écrans.\n- Responsive si le contexte l’exige ; sinon préciser le device principal.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Traçabilité\n\n- Chaque story (si présente) référence FR et SC concernés.\n- Les liens entre fichiers assurent la cohérence interne.\n- Toute incertitude = NEEDS CLARIFICATION → traiter dans plan.md.\n\n---\n\n## 11. Version et historique\n\n- Mise à jour du statut : Draft → Reviewed → Approved.\n- Documenter les changements majeurs :\n  - ajout / modification de règle métier,\n  - nouveau cas d’usage,\n  - rupture de compatibilité éventuelle.\n\n---\n\n## 12. Validation constitutionnelle\n\nAvant d’approuver une spec :\n\n- Stories indépendantes et en français.\n- Scénarios d’acceptation mesurables.\n- Tests identifiés (contrat / intégration).\n- UX conforme à la Constitution AFA.\n\n---\n\n## 13. Organisation des incréments et workflow Git\n\n- Les spécifications sont regroupées par incrément fonctionnel :\n\n  specs/NNN-nom-increment/\n\n- Un incrément peut contenir :\n  - uniquement du frontend (screen-*.md),\n  - uniquement du backend (api-*.md),\n  - uniquement du modèle (entity-*.md),\n  - ou une combinaison des trois.\n\n- Chaque incrément correspond à une branche Git dédiée :\n\n  NNN-nom-increment\n\n- Les templates globaux doivent être utilisés comme référence.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d.

That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]}}

Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d.

That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n","images":[]}}

Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]}}

Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d.

Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n","images":[]}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/david/projets/spec2code/atelier/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).
